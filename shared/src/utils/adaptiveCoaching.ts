 * AI assistant always agree, and pure so every rule is unit-tested.
 *
 * Principles:
 * - Pain is conservative: it can only reduce load or suggest a substitute,
 *   never increase.
 * - Feedback nudges; it never replaces the progression engine. With no
 *   recent feedback, suggestions are exactly what they were before.
 * - Every adjustment carries a reason the UI shows, and the user can decline.
