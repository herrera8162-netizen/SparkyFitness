/**
 * The end-of-workout feedback form, shared by web and mobile so both send
 * the same request for the same answers (issue #1560).
 *
 * The form asks three things: how the session felt overall, whether
 * anything hurt (and optionally which exercises and a note), and — for
 * people who want to — how each exercise felt. Pain is recorded on the
 * session (with the note) and additionally on each exercise named, so
 * adaptive suggestions can back off exactly those exercises.
